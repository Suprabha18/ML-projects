Mental Burnout Detector (ML Project)
📌 Overview

The Mental Burnout Detector is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts a user’s burnout level based on daily lifestyle factors such as working hours, sleep duration, stress level, and breaks.

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be applied to real-world mental health monitoring, enabling early detection and preventive action.

🚀 Why This Project Matters (ML Perspective)

Mental health issues like burnout are complex and non-linear — they cannot be accurately assessed using simple rules.

This is where Machine Learning becomes powerful:

🤖 Pattern Recognition
ML models learn hidden relationships between inputs like stress, sleep, and work hours that are difficult to model manually.

📊 Data-Driven Decisions
Instead of guessing burnout levels, predictions are based on trained data, making them more reliable.

🔍 Multi-Factor Analysis
Burnout depends on multiple factors simultaneously. ML handles this complexity effectively.

⚡ Real-Time Prediction
Once trained, the model can instantly predict burnout levels for new users.

📈 Scalability
The system can be improved over time with more data, making predictions smarter and more accurate.

🧠 Machine Learning Model Used

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Why Random Forest?

Handles multiple features efficiently

Reduces overfitting

Provides stable and accurate predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

Pandas – Data handling and preprocessing

Scikit-learn – ML model training and prediction

Streamlit – Web app interface

Pickle – Model saving and loading

⚙️ How It Works

User inputs:

Work hours

Sleep hours

Stress level (slider input)

Breaks per day

Input data is converted into a structured format (DataFrame)

The trained ML model processes the input

The model predicts burnout level:

Low

Medium

High

The app also provides:

Visual stress indication

Reasons for burnout

Basic suggestions for improvement

🌍 Real-World Importance

This project shows how ML can be used in:

🏫 Student Life – Managing academic stress

💼 Work Environments – Monitoring employee burnout

🧘 Personal Well-being – Encouraging healthy habits

It acts as a preventive tool, helping users take action before burnout becomes severe.
